# infytq-minimum-consecutive-number-in-a-matrix
Given a m Ã— n matrix inmatrix of positive integers, print an integer outnum based on the below logic:      Identify all possible sets in inmatrix that contain at least four consecutive elements of the same value val, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally     If only one set of consecutive elements is identified, store the value val in outnum     If more than one set of consecutive elements is identified, find the smallest value and store it in outnum     If no set of four consecutive elements of the same value is identified either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, print -1  Assumption:      m and n will be greater than 3  Input format:  First line will contain number of rows m of inmatrix  The next m lines will contain the elements of inmatrix. Each line will have n elements separated by space.  Read the input from the standard input stream.  Output format:  Print outnum to the standard output stream.
